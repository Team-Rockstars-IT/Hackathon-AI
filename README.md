# AI Hackathon üß†
Welcome to the README.md of the AI Hackathon! During this hackathon we will develop a webapplication for which we will have AI tooling generate most of the code. The end goal is to write as little code ourselves as possible and even try to keep refactoring to a minimum.

To get you started we have prepared an assignment for you. Of course you are free to deviate from this assignment as you which but it will give you some guardrails.

## Assignment üíª
Develop a web application with a use case that utilises the ChatGPT LLM using the OpenAI Completion API.

You can think of use cases like:
- Recipe suggestions: build an application that will suggest cooking recipes based on the leftover groceries you have at home.
- Virtual study counsellor: Create an interactive study counsellor.
- Anti-polarization tool: An application that gives you a viewpoint both for and against difficult topics.
- Any other use case that you can think of.

## Rules üìú
- Develop a webapplication 
- Write as little lines of code yourself as you can
- Use the programming language and/or framework of your choice
- Use your IDE of choice
- Generate sprites and UI elements with Midjourney or Bing Images
- Bootstrapping of the application (e.g. via `start.spring.io`, `ng new`, `dotnet new ...`, `npx create-react-app my-app`) doesn't need to be generated and doesn't count as lines of code written
- Implement the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)
  - API Key in Discord
  - Use model `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Optional: Share your ChatGPT conversation in our discord

## Beware! ‚ùó
- Don't leak your API key to the public.
- Watch your API usages (requests & tokens per minute are limited)

## Support üó£Ô∏è
During the hackathon, you can ask the organisers for help or with ideas from prompts. If you don't have access to Midjourney or GPT-4 they can help you as well.
